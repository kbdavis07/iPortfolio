Brian also has a lot of amazing ideas for improving scaling of architecture and infrastructure.\n\nAt JobNimbus, he was our Datadog Guru. He is a master at finding the right data and pinpointing the source of performance issues and API problems. Brian provided us meaningful monitors and alerts, as well as information that both helped us resolve incidents faster and enabled us to react to them more quickly. His thorough analysis and sharp intuition were key to resolving many issues in our CI/CD and infrastructure.\n\nSome of Brian's other top skills include .NET, Couchbase, AWS, and other tools like RabbitMQ.\n\nWhat I love most about Brian is how team-committed and caring he is. He is a good mentor and often comes to you out of the blue with new solutions that apply to the problems you've talked with him about. He will seek out knowledge and thoughtfully and eagerly share it. He helped me learn Datadog and taught me a lot about our architecture and system. I'm better at my job because of him.\n\nYou could not have a better data guy than Brian on your team, and I heartily recommend him if you are looking for a talented software engineer and all-around great person!"
